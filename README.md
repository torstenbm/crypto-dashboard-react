# React Crypto Dashboard

Goal of this project is to put some the technology developed in my master's thesis into practical use. 

As of now the dashboard only queries and retrieves price data for user-selected crypto currencies. The goal is to integrate with either AsterixDB, or some other technology, to scrape historic tweets and/or ingest new tweets enriched with an analysed sentiment (using Naive Bayes or an RNN) in order to analyse crypto currency values with regards to their twitter sentiment scores.
